          <p class="para1 sans-serif"> How much of our solid waste is plastic? The Environmental Protection Agency reports plastic made up 12% of the 254 million tons of waste generated in 2007. That’s more than 30 million tons of plastic in one year. Some reports state plastic materials
            can take hundreds of years to break down in a landfill. When you take part in our plastics recycling program, you join a network of Green-minded people and companies who recycle millions of tons of plastics across the United States annually.
          </p>
          <p class="para12 sans-serif"> And, for every 1 ton of plastic that’s recycled, reports estimate that 7 yards of landfill space is saved. By recycling, you can also help conserve the additional 80% of energy that’s typically used when making new plastic bottles, containers
            and other items instead of recycling. It’s easy to see why recycling plastic is so important.</p>
          <p class="para12 sans-serif"> Baled plastics, specifically plastic bottles, have a high scrap value per ton. In fact, the only other recyclable that’s more lucrative is aluminum cans. Complete Recycling partners with you to ensure your business gets the most value out of
            your plastic recyclables. We do this through education on how to sort different resins and through our equipment leasing programs.</p>
